          Creating this website with Next.js and Tailwind CSS was a bit like
          trying to assemble a furniture without the instructions - a few
          stumbles and a lot of{" "}
          <q>
            <i>what does this part even do?</i>
          </q>{" "}
          moments.
          <br />
          But hey, even the best chefs use recipes, right? I took help from some
          cool resources to make this project.
          <br />
          <br />
          Here are my secret weapons that made this project possible. ðŸš€

        <div className="mb-14 mt-5 flex flex-col text-base">
          <Link
            href="https://flowbite.com"

            I went on a bit of a component shoppingðŸ›’ spree at Flowbite,
            grabbing awesome stuff like the <b>Navbar</b>, <b>Footer</b>, and
            some snazzy <b>SVG icons</b>. You could say it was a component heist
            of epic proportions! ðŸ’Ž
            <br />
            <br />
            But here's where it gets interesting. While I borrowed these goodies
            from Flowbite, I had to sprinkle some of my own coding magic to make
            them responsive. I mean, who needs a <b>flowbite.js</b> wizard when
            you've got your own skills? ðŸ˜Ž
